# Wannabe Challenge

Live Demo: https://wannabe-challenge.vercel.app/

A project made with Next 13 and Typescript, it gets the data from https://swapi.dev/ and shows it on the pages. It has pagination and a search box to search a desired character.

## Decision making

- Choosed Next framework because it helps with server-side-rendering and routing.
- Handled character id with a helper function because the api doesn't provide it.
- Made a reusable component to show the characters in screen.
- Used routing for pagination.
